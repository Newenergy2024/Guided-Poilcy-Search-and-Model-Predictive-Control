# Guided-Poilcy-Search-and-Model-Predictive-Control
This method replaces the state estimation of the system in MPC with policy search, and replaces the off-line trajectory optimization used in guided policy search with MPC. It combines the advantages of both, improves the control accuracy, reduces the system energy consumption and enhances the system robustness.
